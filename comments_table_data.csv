2|No executive summary has been included although this was an expected/required feature.|AB02|0|ABSTRACT|Aoife Dynan|dynan-a@ulster.ac.uk
3|The abstract is not of an appropriate length; It should typically be 150-250 words and should fit comfortably on a single side of A4.|AB03|1|ABSTRACT|Aoife Dynan|dynan-a@ulster.ac.uk
4|The abstract is not properly constructed; There should be no repetition; The text should flow logically; The abstract should succinctly summarise the entire document including final outcomes and conclusions; Quantitative findings should also be summarised; Abstracts are best written when the other work has been completed; Refereed Journals provide good sources for exemplars.|AB04|0|ABSTRACT|Aoife Dynan|dynan-a@ulster.ac.uk
5|The executive summary is not properly constructed; It should be 3-5 times the length of the abstract and should contain more detail, throughout, while avoiding repetition and peripheral detail; upon reading the abstract and executive summary, the reader should have a good grasp of the underlying topic(s)/themes, what has been achieved, the resulting conclusions, the important outcomes, the principal quantitative outcomes and the relevance of the work in a wider context.|AB05|1|ABSTRACT|Aoife Dynan|dynan-a@ulster.ac.uk
6|There is little or no introductory material and there has been a tendency to dive into the meat of the work without preparing the reader, by leading gradually into the subject-matter.|IM01|0|INTRO|Aoife Dynan|dynan-a@ulster.ac.uk
7|The scope of the introductory material is inadequate and there is insufficient review of relevant background information which underpins the work being reported; There should be adequate referencing within the introduction to demonstrate relevant wider reading in the relevant areas, cognate with the topic.|IM02|0|INTRO|Aoife Dynan|dynan-a@ulster.ac.uk

9|Irrelevant or inappropriate material has been included in the introductory material.|IM04|0|INTRO|Aoife Dynan|dynan-a@ulster.ac.uk
